= Params-Validate-Checks-Net =

This is the Cpan distribution of the Params::Validate::Checks::Net Perl module.

Params::Validate::Checks::Net provides some named checks for use with
Params::Validate, to specify that certain function or method parameters should
be networky things:

  use Params::Validate::Checks qw<validate as>;
  use Params::Validate::Checks::Net;

  sub configure_website
  {
    my %arg = validate @_,
    {
      website => {as 'domain'},
      nameserver => {as 'domain'},
      ip_address => {as 'public_ip_address'},
    };

    # Do something with $arg{website}, $arg{nameserver}, $arg{ip_address} ...
  }

  sub check_network
  {
    my %arg = validate @_.
    {
      device => {as 'hostname'},
      mac_address => {as 'mac_address'},
      timeout => {as 'pos_int', default => 10},
    };

    # Do something with $arg{device}, $arg{mac_address}, $arg{timeout} ...
  }
